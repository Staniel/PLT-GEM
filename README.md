# PLT-GEM Language for RPG game design

GEM is a static typed and game oriented language. Our language is aiming to minimize the fuss of understanding how elements interact with each other in the low level, and to maximize the fun of injecting ideas into actual game, all of which is accompanied by a programmatic style of game designing instead of brainstorming on napkins or following strictly predefined framework.

Users can design a compelling story for game players to experience, which contains several phases, and then program in our language to make it a real game. At each stage, users can define the type of event such as a battle. Different choices in each stage can lead to different subsequent storyline.

High freedom to design game and define various skills/events/battles.

Encapsulation of events and game logic into objects, while defining interface for user to extend into concrete objects that will make up the whole game. We’ll provide several types of interface for general purposes, which can be based on various input and choices of users.

User can easily create story with fighting scenes with built­in battle system. Users only need to define characters in the battle without implementing the logic of it.
